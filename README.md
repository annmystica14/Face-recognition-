ABSTRACT
The SmartEdu system is an innovative and intelligent monitoring solution designed to automate attendance tracking and academic supervision in educational institutions using face recognition technology. By leveraging computer vision, machine learning, and data visualization tools like Matplotlib, this project aims to enhance traditional attendance systems that rely on manual processes, thus improving accuracy, security, and operational efficiency.At the core of the system is a real-time face recognition module developed using Python libraries such as face_recognition, OpenCV, and dlib. This module detects and identifies multiple faces from a live webcam feed. When a student’s face is recognized, their profile—including name, section, and department—is fetched from an SQLite database and displayed on the screen. If the face is unknown, a red box is shown to alert the user, and registration can be done via an intuitive PyQt5 interface. 
A dynamic attendance management system is integrated, where attendance is marked automatically based on recognition and cross-referenced with the current subject code using a predefined timetable logic. Additionally, a manual marking option is available via touch or button click for special cases. Attendance records are stored in a separate attendance.db file and are subject-specific, timestamped, and organized for easy access. To provide insightful analytics, Matplotlib is used to generate graphical reports and visual dashboards that highlight attendance trends, subject-wise participation, and student-wise presence statistics. This project serves as a complete academic monitoring suite, combining artificial intelligence with smart UI design to deliver a seamless user experience. It also supports exporting to a standalone executable, enabling easy deployment on any institution’s systems.
